 The Svanberg beam model was developed for:
 >  Svanberg, Krister. "The Method of Moving Asymptotes-A New Method for Structural Optimization." International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 24.2 (1987): 359-373.

## Design Problem
Given section thickness (t), the height (x_j) of five sections is optimized for minimum weight subject to a displacement constraint.
