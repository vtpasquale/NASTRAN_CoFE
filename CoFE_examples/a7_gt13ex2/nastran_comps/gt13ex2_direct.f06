   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
   The highlights for the MSC Nastran 2014.1 release include:
  
     HPC
     -   MSC Nastran 2014.1 now provides a parallel(SMP)version of the CASI
         iterative solver (SMETHOD=element)
     -   For large SOL 101 or 400 solid element models, users can expect as much
         as a 3x reduction in wall clock time with SMP=8.
  
     Capabilities
     -   Allows one to consider the weight based upon property id or
         material id to be the response. This allows you tomake better design
         decisions. New response type WMPID is given via DRESP1. This design
         response cannot beused with topology optimization at this time.
         One may also obtain the total weight based upon the material id.
  
     Delivery
     -   Win 7 32-bit is no longer available
1    -   The I4 and I8 installers have been split.
  
  
    Documentation
  
     The complete documentation set is provided in a separate installer and when
     installed is available at:
     MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/pdf_nastran directory.
     Where MSC_DOC_DIR is the directory where documentation was installed
     This help set has cross references between documents, links to how-to
     videos, and example files.
  
    Individual MSC Nastran documents are available for download from the
      Simcompanion Website at:
      http://simcompanion.mscsoftware.com/
  
    These documents were updated for the MSC Nastran 2014.1 Release
