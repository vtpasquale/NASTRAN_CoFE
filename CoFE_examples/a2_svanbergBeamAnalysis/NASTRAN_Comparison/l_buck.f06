   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
   The highlights for the MSC Nastran 2013 release include:
  •   HPC
     –   GPU Support for non-symmetric and complex systems encountered in
           SOL 108, SOL 109, SOL 111 and SOL 112
     –   Element Assembly Time has been Improved using Parallel Processing in
           SOL 400
     –   SOL 700 DMP Improvements for FSI applications
     –   MSC Nastran now fully utilizes the memory for All Solutions Sequences
           which reduces the amount of wall time.
     -   New methods have been introduced to Control Pivoting strategies when
           Factorizing the System of Equation, to provide a balance between
           Performance and Accuracy
  •   Acoustics
     –   Poroelastic Materials which are Frequency Dependant can be included in
           Interior Acoustic Simulation to model trim materials
  •   Durability
     –   Fatigue Simulations may be performed from within MSC Nastran for
1          SOL 101, SOL 103, SOL 112 and SOL 200
     -   There is a new User Guide fully describing this new capability
  •   Optimization
     –   Optimization may be performed using Design Life as either a Constraint
         or an Objective Function.
     –   Enhancements to Equivalent Radiated Power (ERP)
  •   Linear Analysis
     –   Enhancements to Transfer Path Analysis (TPA) to support inter-component
           forces
     -   The Definition of Loads in Dynamic Analysis has been Improved.
  •   Aeroelasticity
     –   Output enhancements with Monitor Points for SOL 146
  •   Advanced Nonlinear (SOL 400)
     –   Support for enforced relative displacement motion SPCD and SPCR
     –   Export Adams MNF files from SOL 400 for nonlinear preload
  •   Explicit Dynamics (SOL 700)
     –   1D-3D Spherical Symmetry and 2D-3D Axial Symmetry Remap for Blast Loads
     –   Support for Multiple Detonation points with varying ignition times
     –   Empirical Blast Load Models
